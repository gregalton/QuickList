# Visual Quick List

Just because I always wanted a list app that worked in this way. Text is a fallback. It's meant to be visual and easy to operate with one hand. Images and text are stored on the device. No data is collected or transmitted.

If you uninstall, all data will be removed from your device.

This app doesn't meet Apple's minimum content requirement, so I won't be listing it. Only those with developer certificates can use it. 

I believe apps should do one thing very well and very fast by simplifying the architecture. Visual Quick List is a great example ot that.
